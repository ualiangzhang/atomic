Installation
============
The files in this repository are currently meant to be run in scripts. This will likely change soon-ish. For now the main pre-requisite is that you have `atomic` version of psychsim installed (see the `github repo`_ for instructions).

With the atomic psychsim package installed you'll be able to run the scripts from the command line, or you favorite IDE.
